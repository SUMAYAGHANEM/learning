# *growth mind set* 
### what is a growth mindset ? 
it's a concept for life , it means you should keep on  **learning, acheiving, and open to try new things.** 
in contrast, **the fixed mindset** believes that intellegance and natural tallent are good enough to keep on top , to keep you motivated and happy.
which is in my opinion, and from my experience a ~~wrong concept~~. <P>
