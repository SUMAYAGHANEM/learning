# javascript :
Each version of a web browser adds new features,Often these new features make tasks easier,
and better, than using older techniques. 
Online, you will find alternatives available for each example that does not work in IE8.
But please *check the comments in those code samples to make sure you know about the issues involved in using them*
### the basics:
Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in
the browser is very powerful.
* **examples**
* Access the content of the page
* Modify the content of the page
* Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
* React to events triggered by the user or browser 
**What is a script and how do I create one?**
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
WRITING A SCRIPT:
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. Start with the big picture of whatyou want to achieve, and breakthat down into smaller steps. 1: DEFINE THE GOAL 2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT 3: CODE EACH STEP
EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value.
* Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
 * EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign). var color = ‘beige’;
 * EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE individual values (see next page) to determine a single value. For example: var area = 3 * 2.
 **OPERATORS**
* ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS color = ‘beige’; The value of co 1 or is now beige
* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS Perform basic math area = 3 * 2; The value of area is now 6
* STRING OPERATORS Combine two strings greeting= ‘Hi 1 + ‘Mol ly’; The value of greeting is now Hi Molly.
* COMPARISON OPERATORS Compare two values and return true or fa1se buy = 3 > 5; The value of buy is fa1se.
* LOGICAL OPERATORS Combine expressions and return true or fa1se buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); The value of buy is now true.
**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). heres a example of HTML coding <!DOCTYPE html>
Before the closing </body> tag, you can see the link to the JavaScript file. The JavaScript file starts with a variable used to hold a new message, and is followed by a function called updateMessage(). Basic Function</title> </head> TravelWorthy</ hl>
We lcome to our site! </ div> </ body> </ html> 
**here is an example of JAVASCRIPT coding**:
var msg = 'Sign up to receive our newsletter for 10% off!'; function updateMessage() { var el = document.getElementByld('message'}; el .textContent = msg; } updateMessage(}; End of read 4
