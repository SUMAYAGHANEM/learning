# css
css is designing program to make the html paage look good with colors, fonts,borders and different elemants.
CSS allows you to create rules that control theway that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.
### a csss rule contain 2 parts :
* selector
* decleration
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.
* you can include the css file inside html using the link , ( work on css in external file then link it inside html )
* You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element

## color:
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
* rgb values
* hex codes
* color names

**background-color**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background.
*When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible*
